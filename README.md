# autoFormer

A simple python script designed to autofill the google form required to access
my school's library (every day, we enter the same form with our name, which
gets incredibly frusterating).

If you want to use this, you'll need to install [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org)
and place it in the root directory of this project.
